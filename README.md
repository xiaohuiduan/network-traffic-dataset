## The Network Traffic Dataset

The flowing folders are traffic data which are collected by others. You can use them for your study or research but just obey your local rules.

**If you have other data, please pull a request!!!**

It is so import that I have to repeat it three times.

- "欧洲某城市核心网"：Internet traffic data (in bits) from a private ISP with centres in 11 European cities. The data corresponds to a transatlantic link and was collected from 06:57 hours on 7 June to 11:17 hours on 31 July 2005. Data collected at five minute intervals.
- "英国学术主干网"：Internet traffic data (in bits) from an ISP. Aggregated traffic in the United Kingdom academic network backbone. It was collected between 19 November 2004, at 09:30 hours and 27 January 2005, at 11:11 hours. Data collected at five minute intervals.
- "lbl-tcp-3"：This trace contains two hours' worth of all wide-area TCP traffic between the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and the rest of the world.

This project is just for study and research, if you are using them for your business, please obey your local laws.



## 网络流量数据集 

这些数据集都是来自网上的数据集，供大家学习参考。

**如果你也有比较好的数据集，也可以共同构建这个repo！！**
