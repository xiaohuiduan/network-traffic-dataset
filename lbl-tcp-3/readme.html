<b>Description</b>
</dt><dd>
This trace contains two hours' worth of all wide-area TCP traffic between
the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and the rest of the world.
</dd><dt>
<b>Format</b>
</dt><dd>
The trace was reduced from
<a href="ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/tcpdump.tar.Z"><em>tcpdump</em></a>
format to ASCII using the
<a href="file:///C:/Users/XiaoHui/Desktop/sanitize.html"> sanitize-tcp</a> and
<a href="file:///C:/Users/XiaoHui/Desktop/sanitize.html"> sanitize-syn-fin</a> scripts.  The first script
was used to produce <em>lbl-tcp-3.tcp</em>, which has six columns:
timestamp, (renumbered) source host, (renumbered) destination host,
source TCP port, destination TCP port, and number of data bytes (zero
for "pure-ack" packets).  The second script generated <em>lbl-tcp-3.sf</em>,
which includes the same first five columns, plus TCP flags (SYN/FIN/RST/PSH
etc.), sequence number, and acknowledgement number (0 for initial SYN).
</dd><dt>
<b>Measurement</b>
</dt><dd>
The trace ran from 14:10 to 16:10 on Thursday, January 20, 1994 (times
are Pacific Standard Time), capturing 1.8 million TCP packets (about 0.0002
of these were dropped).  The tracing was done on the Ethernet DMZ network over
which flows all traffic into or out of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory,
located in Berkeley, California.
The raw trace was made using 
<a href="ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/tcpdump.tar.Z"><em>tcpdump</em></a>
on a Sun Sparcstation using the
<a href="ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/papers/bpf-usenix93.ps.Z">BPF</a>
kernel packet filter.  Timestamps have microsecond precision.
</dd><dt>
<b>Privacy</b>
</dt><dd>
The trace has been "sanitized" using the
<a href="file:///C:/Users/XiaoHui/Desktop/sanitize.html"> sanitize-tcp</a> script.  This means that
the host IP addresses have been renumbered, and all packet contents
removed.
